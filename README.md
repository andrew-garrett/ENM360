# ENM360
HWs for ENM360

ENM360 (Introduction to Data-Driven Modeling) is an undergraduate course offered at UPenn which covers topics in machine learning and statistical modeling.  Under the guidance of Professor Perdikaris and PhD candidate Georgios Kissas, we covered both theory and implementation of regressions, gradient descent/optimization, several different Neural Network architechtures, activation and loss functions, sampling methods, and dimensionality of data.  Being honest, this was by far my favorite course I have taken in my undergraduate at Penn.  Although the course is difficult, it is taught phenomenally and gives a fantastic introduction to machine learning, from both fundamentals to state of the art technology.  In this repo, I have attached the homeworks that we worked on throughout the course.  Although Dr. Perdikaris and Georgios provided the skeleton for each homework, as well as office hours to help students work through the difficult content, I learned so much by writing code which implemented what we learned in the course.

All the code written in this repo uses the JAX library, in addition to more common libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch, etc.

I am new-ish to the github scene, so if anyone has questions or concerns about me posting this, please let me know!  I dont want to upset anyone, and the purpose of this is not to promote cheating but rather to showcase some of the beautiful topics in machine learning.
